# Contributing to ADC

Hello, i love your interest in contributing but you can only contribute to the ADC Canary repo! Your features or fixes will be eventually added to stable.

Canary is the live development repo on GitLab, after a working function or bugfix it will be pushed straight to Aurora, which will eventually become Stable

You can find the repo and contributing.md for Canary here: [https://gitlab.com/Mealman1551/adc-canary](https://gitlab.com/Mealman1551/adc-canary)

I hope to see your contribution soon :D
