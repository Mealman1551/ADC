### How to use Aurora?

Aurora works with a rolling release model by updating the source code to a higher version, with every great version like e.g. 1.3.0 it will be ported to stable release, I will plan this to 2 great stable updates per year as in the meanwhile Aurora is the roling release.

Additional Installation Requirements

Most of these libraries are included in the default Python installation. However, on some systems, tkinter may need to be installed separately.
