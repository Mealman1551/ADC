## Notes

### No macOS support
ADC Archiver does **not** support macOS, and it never will.
This is a deliberate decision to take a stand against the growing dominance of proprietary ecosystems and Apple’s developer restrictions.
This project supports **open platforms only**: Windows and Linux.

You can ofc run the source code but official binary and/or setups are not compiled for macOS!
