### What is Aurora?

Aurora is the unstable/rolling release of ADC Archiver that features a newer version than stable and is only usable as a Python script.

### Which Python version is needed?

Aurora and the main branch use Python 3.12.x

### When to use Aurora?

Aurora is perfect for users who prefer cutting-edge updates over stability.

### Where can I request features or get support?

GitHub issues related to Aurora will not be handled!

### How to use Aurora?

Aurora follows a rolling release model by updating the source code to a higher version. With every major version (e.g., 1.3.0), it will be ported to the stable release. I plan to release two major stable updates per year, while Aurora continues as a rolling release.

### Python packages required

- os
- zlib
- tkinter
- socket
- time
- progress
- progress.bar

### Additional Installation Requirements

Some of these libraries are included in the default Python installation.

The `socket`, `tkinter`, `progress`, and `progress.bar` modules need to be installed separately on some systems.
